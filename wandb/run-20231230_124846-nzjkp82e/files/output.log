/home/nlp-04/anaconda3/envs/test/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyarrow/pandas_compat.py:373: FutureWarning: is_sparse is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Check `isinstance(dtype, pd.SparseDtype)` instead.
  if _pandas_api.is_sparse(col):
Some weights of RobertaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-large and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
